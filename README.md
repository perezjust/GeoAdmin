# GeoAdmin

## Domain Tools

* Reorganize Domains in Alphabetic order.  Domains get out of order because they are in the order they were added.

* Check table for values outside of Domain.  Generate Domain difference list that can be used in subsequent tool to add back to Domain.

* Export Domains out to geodatabase enmasse for entire table.

* Search Domains by table and show values.
